# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily designed for processing and analyzing visual data like images and videos. They are a subset of artificial neural networks and have revolutionized the field of computer vision. CNNs are particularly well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and more. Here are the key components and concepts of CNNs:

Convolutional Layers: CNNs use convolutional layers as their building blocks. These layers consist of small filters (also called kernels) that slide over the input image, performing element-wise multiplication and aggregation to create feature maps. Convolutional layers are responsible for capturing local patterns and features.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers, often referred to as max-pooling or average-pooling, reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps by downsampling. This helps in reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting by retaining only the most important information from the feature maps.

Activation Functions: Non-linear activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied after convolution and pooling operations. They introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex relationships in the data.

Fully Connected Layers: After several convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs often have one or more fully connected (dense) layers. These layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, similar to traditional neural networks. Fully connected layers are typically used for classification or regression tasks.

Flattening: Before the fully connected layers, the feature maps are usually flattened into a one-dimensional vector. This flattening operation is necessary to connect the output of the convolutional layers to the fully connected layers.

Strides and Padding: Convolutional layers can have different strides (step size for filter movement) and padding options (zero-padding around the input) to control the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps.

Multiple Channels: CNNs can handle images with multiple channels, such as RGB color images (3 channels). In such cases, the convolutional filters are also multi-channel, and each filter produces a feature map for each channel.

Deep Architectures: CNNs are often deep architectures with multiple convolutional layers stacked on top of each other. Deeper networks can learn hierarchical features, from low-level edges and textures to high-level object representations.

Pretrained Models: Pretrained CNN models like VGG, ResNet, and Inception have been trained on massive datasets and are often used as a starting point for transfer learning in various computer vision tasks.

CNNs have been remarkably successful in image-related tasks and have also found applications in other domains, such as natural language processing (e.g., for text classification) and speech recognition (e.g., for audio spectrogram analysis), by adapting their architecture and techniques to suit different data types.
